Project 9- Pokemon API
This project was definitely difficult, digging through all the different APIS and needing to call them at specific points throughout my file was very reqarding when I finally pulled the right data points that I needed.
Jacob is very smart and he helped me with a few weird errors that were hapening mainly with my Favorites tab and other minor things that I couldn't figure out on my own üëç

//Review: Spacing is very small so on my 4k monitor it looks a bit odd
Text is hard to read and should have been spaced out more.
The favorites menu is spaced out too much and should have been closer together.
I dislike the list of names on the favorites menu and it should have been underneath the sprite
Love the popup when you click favorites
I do really like the additions of the sprites, the animation looks really nice.
Color choices are a a bit bland, especially with the empty space in the background.
Responsiveness is great! I would have liked some bottom margins for the text area so that it didnt touch my taskbar, makes it even harder to read.
The location data should have had some of the text fluff removed.
I like the way that the evolutions list looks, but would have liked a dash prior to the gt/ls symbol, to help better clarify.
